# Task-Dependency-Visualiser
An Interactive Task Dependency Visualizer is a web app that lets users create tasks, draw dependencies between them, and analyze project structure using classic algorithms: Topological Sort (for ordering tasks where possible) and Critical Path Analysis (to identify the longest path of dependent tasks determining project duration).

This repository contains a clean, highly-interactive UI, an algorithmic core, and utilities for importing/exporting project graphs. It's ideal for project managers, software teams, students studying graph algorithms, and anyone who wants to visualize and reason about task dependencies.
